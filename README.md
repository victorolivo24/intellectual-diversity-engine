## üìñ About The Project

In an increasingly polarized media landscape, it's easy to get stuck in a "You-loop"‚Äîan information bubble where we are repeatedly exposed to the same perspectives and emotional tones. **Out of the Loop** is a tool designed to provide users with a data-driven overview of their own media consumption habits.

With a single click, the Chrome extension performs real-time sentiment analysis on any news article. This data is then sent to a private, personalized web dashboard where users can track trends, visualize their reading history, and gain a more conscious understanding of their "information diet."

The goal is not to label sources as "good" or "bad," but to empower users with self-awareness.
